# Parametric-Scaling-Based-Tuning-of-a-Direct-Fuzzy-Controller
The proposed method was validated using an HIL scheme emulating the behavior of a level plant. The model was executed in LabVIEW, while the FLC ran on a Siemens S7-1200 PLC. The final results show that the proposed method, based on the fine-tuning regions obtained.
